   One exam.

   This is the page a calendar event links to, so its address is effectively
   permanent once anyone has subscribed: exam.html?exam=6311. The shape is set
   in config.py as EXAM_URL_TEMPLATE. Changing it breaks links that are already
   sitting in people's calendars.

   The page answers three questions in order: can I still apply, when is the
   deadline, and where do I actually apply. Everything else is below that.
