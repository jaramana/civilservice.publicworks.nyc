/* ==========================================================================
   One job title.

   The honest shape of this page is that most titles have very little to say:
   a name, a salary band, a union, and no exam. That is not a degraded version
   of the page, it is the normal one, so nothing here renders an empty field or
   apologizes for what the catalog does not carry.

   Two numbers on this page could be mistaken for each other and are kept
   apart on purpose:

     salary range   what the title is authorized to pay, from the catalog
     median         what people in the job are actually paid, from
                    The Pay Gap, which is a median and is labeled as one

   Calling either of them "the salary" would be wrong, so neither is.

   A third number is deliberately not shown. The certification data carries
   the salary the City reported when it hired off a list, averaged over the
   last few years of certifications. It is still exported as salary_hiring for
   anyone reading the JSON, but it does not belong on this page: it is a mean
   of past hires, some of them years old and none of them adjusted, so putting
   it next to a current salary range invites someone to read a stale figure as
   what the job pays today. Two salary numbers with different meanings is
   already the most this page can carry honestly.
