/* ==========================================================================
   Shared helpers.

   Everything on this site is a static file plus fetch. There is no framework
   and no build step, so this file is the closest thing to shared plumbing:
   loading JSON, formatting a date the way a person reads one, and drawing the
   freshness line that every page carries.

   One rule worth stating because it is easy to break later: values that came
   out of the pipeline are written with textContent, never innerHTML. The data
   is public and dull, but a title with an ampersand in it should render as an
   ampersand rather than start an entity, and the habit is what keeps that
   true when a field changes.

/* --- freshness -----------------------------------------------------------
   Silent staleness is the failure mode that matters here: a page that quietly
   keeps showing April's exams looks exactly like a page that is up to date.
   The date comes from the dataset's own data_current_as_of, not the build
   time, so it stays honest even if the refresh workflow keeps running while
   DCAS stops publishing.

   The date is provenance: it applies to the whole site and appears below the
   page title, where readers can see it before using an exam date.

   There is no conditional warning banner any more. It watched datasets that
   carry no application dates, so its age was not evidence about the thing it
   warned about, and a box that appears on a normal day teaches people to
   ignore it. See the note in config.py. What protects application-date
   accuracy now is the daily DCAS reconciliation, which fails the build rather
   than publishing quietly, plus this always-visible date. */
