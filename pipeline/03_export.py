"""
Stage 3: export. Writes the JSON the browser fetches into docs/data/.

Nothing in docs/data/ contains a name, an individual score, or a credit flag.
That is not a filtering step here, it is a consequence of stage 1 never asking
for those columns. See FORBIDDEN_COLUMNS in config.py.

Files written:

  meta.json        freshness, counts, and any staleness warning the page shows
  exams.json       every exam we publish, with its status today
  lists.json       every established Civil Service List, with certification history
  titles.json      every civil service title in the catalog, exam and list attached
  dictionary.json  what every published field means, drives the Data page

There is deliberately no per-candidate score distribution here. An earlier
build published one so a visitor could enter an exam number and their own list
number and see how many people ranked ahead of them. It used counts only and
named nobody, but it was still a list number lookup, and that feature is cut.
Adding it back is a new decision, not a restoration.

About one exam in six has no title here at all: CUNY and Health + Hospitals run exams for titles the City catalog does not carry, and the catalog's 30 character name limit means some longer exam names have nothing to match.
